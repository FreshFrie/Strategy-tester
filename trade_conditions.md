You got the trade entry time conditions correct.

However, we use the asia killzone not to take trades in, but to set up london session trades. So, the asia session in utc time is 22:00 - 04:00. And the asia killzone would be two hours long. The time for the actual asia killzone is 00:00-02:00. This is a very important time you see. So now we must be able to measure the following according to the csv. If during the 22:00 - 4:00 time frame, the session high or low was made during the 00:00-02:00 asia killzone, we are eligable for a trade only if london has not taked that high or low out before the london killzone which is 06:00-09:00. Now, how it works is like this, if the conditions are met, and the asia killzone has not been taken out and did indeed make a high or low, we enter into a possion with our TP target the KZ high or low. So if we were using a Risk to reward of 1:1 we would be risking the ammount of points it would take for price to get to the killzone price level. Now, as for the next condition which is if the asia KZ makes both the high and low of the asia session, we must wait for one side of the kz to get taken out, and if it gets taken out during the london Killzone, we must wait for 1 hour and then enter a trade in the direction targeting the other side of the killzone.
